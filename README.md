# Theology-Ink
Theology & Ink is an interactive theological study designed to explore one debated question within Evangelical Christianity: Can Christians get tattoos? Rather than offering a simple yes-or-no answer, the site guides users through Scripture, theology, and ethical reflection to encourage thoughtful, biblically grounded discernment.

The study begins with careful biblical exegesis of Leviticus 19:28, examining the historical and religious context of the command and its meaning within the Ancient Near East. It then introduces a theological framework that explains how Evangelical scholars understand the Mosaic Law—distinguishing between moral, ceremonial, and civil commands—and why this distinction matters for modern believers.

Building on this foundation, the site presents key New Testament principles such as the body as the temple of the Holy Spirit, Christian liberty, and the responsibility to avoid becoming a stumbling block to others. It also compares modern Evangelical perspectives, showing how different theological priorities shape either cautious or liberty-based approaches.

Finally, Theology & Ink offers an interactive decision framework that helps users examine their motives, conscience, content, and long-term wisdom. The goal is not to dictate behavior, but to cultivate mature Christian thinking—where freedom is guided by faith, love, and the glory of God.

This project is intended as a learning tool, not a moral verdict: a space where theology, culture, and personal conviction meet with clarity, humility, and grace.
